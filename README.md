# Flexyear

Flexible years! Parse decades, ranges, and etc into low & high values.

Examples:

```ruby
FlexYear.new("1980s").year_low == 1980
FlexYear.new("1980s").year_high == 1989

FlexYear.new("mid-80s").year_low == 1983
FlexYear.new("mid-80s").year_high == 1986

FlexYear.new(1983).year_low == 1983
FlexYear.new(1983).year_high == 1983

FlexYear.new(["1980s", "1988 - 2000", 2001]).year_low == 1980
FlexYear.new(["1980s", "1988 - 2000", 2001]).year_high == 2001
```

It's pretty flexible in the kinds of things it takes. For more examples, see the spec.
