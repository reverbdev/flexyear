# Flexyear

Flexible years! Parse decades, ranges, and etc into low & high values.

Examples:

    FlexYear.new("1980s").year_low = 1980
    FlexYear.new("1980s").year_high == 1989

    FlexYear.new("mid-80s").year_low == 1983
    FlexYear.new("mid-80s").year_high == 1986

It's pretty flexible in the kinds of things it takes. For more examples, see the spec.
